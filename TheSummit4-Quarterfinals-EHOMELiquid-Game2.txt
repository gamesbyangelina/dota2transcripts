K: Hello everybody, welcome back to The Summit final, we are in game number two of our very first series of the day, it's Liquid going up against EHOME, and if you're just [fake yawns] waking up right now, you just missed game number one, and it was Liquid pulling out some good stuff - they took down EHOME. Pretty significantly, EHOME pulling out some fresh material we don't see a lot from them, but put them in a pretty uncomfortable spot, and... well, as we get more opinions about the game number one let's go ahead and go into the draft, because game two is already underway, so. What needs to be changed up? Oh god.
[titles flash up on screen]
S: Behind the schedule... ahead of the schedule... here we go! [A joke is regularly made if ever an event organised by Beyond The Summit goes late]
[EHOME has banned Dark Seer]
[Liquid has banned Queen of Pain]
[EHOME has banned Razor]
F: So... [laughter] no shockers [more laughter] [inaudible]
[Liquid Bans Tusk]
[EHOME Picks Undying]
K: Goddammit Slacks. Don't be like that.
F: No, we *are* ahead of schedule now.
S: That's what I'm saying! It was a nice comment! Undying - what a spookster coming out first.
F: Yeah EHOME, no shocker banning the Razor, they don't wanna have to do deal with FATA Razor.
K: And they're like, we're - we're not doing that Doom again, so. Forget it, you guys can have it.
F: Yeah. Liquid - same bans, you know, obviously the Queen of Pain and the Tusk.
M: Why didn't they pick Undying last game?
F: I dunno. Shadow Fiend and Undying were untouched.
S: Huh.
K: Yeah you're right, the Shadow Fiend got left untouched all the way through.
F: I was very curious about that.
K: I love to touch Shadow Fiend!
S: Wow. Chinese DOTA, you can't have like skeletons and blood and stuff, maybe that was part of it.
F: That AA though, AA has a nice little mouth. He's a little cute guy. [referring to the Chinese edit of DOTA's art style]
S: He does, he has a cute little mouth, if you've ever seen it. [makes weird noise] That's the sound I make every time I look at it. [laughter] [others imitate noise]
F: You've got a lot of interesting sounds.
S: Don't... don't go there, I hear you.
[Liquid Picks Gyrocopter]
K: What's the sound you make when a Gyrocopter gets picked?
S: [does a very good impression of Gyrocopter's voice] Oh Jeez! That's Viper [?] - it's Gyrocopter!
F: That actually sounds just like him. I like that a lot.
[Liquid Picks Wyvern]
K: And the sound for Wyvern?
S: [same Gyrocopter voice] I fuckin' hate Wyvern. [laughter]
K: Alright.
[EHOME Picks Io]
F: That sounds just like it as well, actually.
K: Well, they're flying through right now, EHOME now the team that picks up the Wisp.
F: I like this.
[EHOME Bans Ancient Apparition]
K: And they pick it into a Wyvern?
S: A Wisp! Uh can we talk about Wyvern, Ben [Merlini]? I love listening to you talk, can you talk to me about Winter Wyvern for a little bit? Just.
M: He's nice. He flies.
S: Tight. You're the best, Ben. [laughs] No, why do they pick him, is he good against Undying, or is he just a strong support, or - why so early?
M: Good teamfight, it's also really good anti-push, and EHOME has the tendency to group up a lot. It's also just one of the best supports out there, I'd even say he's better than Dazzle at this current state.
[Liquid Bans Huskar]
S: Ooh.
K: Who also wasn't touched.
F: I wouldn't go that far.
M: They're pretty... they have their...
F: They're different, they're different heroes.
[EHOME Bans Nightstalker]
M: But he's [Wyvern] much better anti-push. If you're worried about somewhat of a grouping-up which EHOME generally like to more than other teams, then it's better than Dazzle. Also Jerax just plays an incredible one.
F: Yeah, and they're really good at playing, like, the um, in like aggressive positions and then they use the fly to just fly into the trees and just TP [teleport] out where you can't see them or anything. So it's really good to be able to push out lanes extremely aggressively.
S: Cool.
[Liquid Bans Tiny]
[Liquid Picks Lina]
S: These guys are very quickly running through the bans - no Huskar, no AA, no Nightstalker, no Tiny, we're looking for a much different game than we had last time.
K: Not surprised to see something like AA banned, you've already got the Undying and Io, that's quite a sustain by itself, gotta get rid of that. Still a bit particular grabbing that Wisp [Io] right away, even with that Wyvern out there, we know Wyvern to be one of those natural counters to the Wisp, makes for easy [Winter's] Curse setups.
M: They play the Wisp a lot differently, though. We saw Kuro [Kuroky, Liquid's captain] use Relocate a lot last game. EHOME they usually play it more five-man rather than three plus two, so it's not that bad of a counter if you play it like that. If you have to relocate in, yeah, you're gonna get owned by the curse but if you use it as a...
[EHOME Picks Viper]
F: Awwhhhhgh
K: God DAMMIT
S: YEAH! My boy, big Vipes! What are you thinking Kotl? [laughs]
K: Disgusting.
S: Can we talk about this, where did this trauma come from with you and Viper, man?
F: It's pretty appropriate versus Gyrocopter, to be honest.
M: Well, and Lina.
F: Yeah and Lina.
M: He destroys Lina.
K: "We're gonna win this frickin' lane."
S: You see? 'Appropriate'. Thank you, Fogged.
K: Can Liquid abandon ship and get, like, Lina into a support position at this point, get something else to be a little bit better in the midlane?
M: There's no good matchup versus Viper, unless you want to pick Razor, and Razor's already banned out, so...
K: OD [Outworld Devourer]
S: OD!?
M: Viper beats OD too.
S: Jeez. You know what Viper doesn't beat? Teamwork. That's how you beat Viper, guys, and that's something that Team Liquid has got in spades, after that last game. References! Hay-oh.
M: They'll probably have Wyvern come and harass him out a lot, though, with the Arctic Burn.
K: But Corrosive Skin, though... the worst...
M: You don't get Corrosive Skin at [level] one though, not normally.
S: Well, okay, who we got next then? We got the Lina, pretty good...
K: Shadow Fiend is gonna be ignored again, can we just talk about that? That just seems ridiculous to me.
S: Seriously?
K: I mean with Lina commitment, and Viper commitment, and feeling like Lina is probably gonna stay to the mid lane, yeah, will be ignored.
S: Well, we'll see! Fogged, do you agree?
F: It does seem like it. I mean, Liquid could put Lina support but then they have a Dire Shadow Fiend and that doesn't seem like it would be the best option...
M: Both of these teams don't really utilise the jungle that much, though.
F: That's true.
M: The Wraith King didn't jungle at all last game, Tiny only did it because he had a terrible laning phase, but even that just got jacked immediately. So it's not so much the stacking and farming that we see... all their ultimates were much lower cooldown than we usually see, except Wraith King's reincarnation. So everyone was just short and bursty like Tiny.
S: That's a very interesting point, Ben. You know who's a great hero for getting in your face without Farming? OMNIKNIGHT. Come on! [Slacks loves Omniknight] Ten seconds! Give it to me, baby! Come on Team Liquid.
F: You kinda gotta farm, you need levels?
S: You don't need anything! [laughter]
F: You don't need anything? Alright level one Omniknight let's go.
S: You need balls. Let's go! Come on!
[Liquid Picks Brewmaster]
S: Whoa! Who was gonna predict that? When's the last time we saw a Brew, boys?
F: OG's like the only team that's been running Brewmaster, as far as I've seen.
S: Woo! What's up? Analysts? Hit me with the knowledge?
M: Newbee plays it a little bit.
F: Newbee did as well, yeah.
M: I forget who else plays it.
F: Uh..
M: Alliance plays Brew too...
F: So what, would that be the midlaner, or...?
K: I was just sitting here thinking, 'What? Is that... now gonna be a Lina support?'
M: I think so... I think Brewmaster matches up pretty okay against Brewmaster...
F: The Drunken Haze?
M: ...yeah, you can go the 3-1-1 build [maximising a skill called Drunken Haze before Level 6]. It's pretty good.
F: Throw some beer at him.
S: Aw, this is going to be an excellent matchup. I'm really hyped about these teams, this is why I love this patch - these random heroes can just be thrown in and, it's a lot of fun, boys.
K: 'Yeah but 6.85's been figured out' [laughter]
F: Yeah, all these heroes are new.
S: They're new! Yeah. It's fun. Don't ask for Abyssal Underlord [the next hero to be released soon] you don't need that.
F: Liquid has a lot of burst on their heroes right now, every single one of them has a nice nuke, a nice solid nuke.
M: They have really good teamfight, and they [EHOME] have no way to stop the Brewmaster split too.
K: What if they just grab that Doom that's still out there?
F: That's one that will, could stop/deter the teamfight, yeah.
M: I don't think they value it that highly though.
K: Skywrath then? Put Undying in like a...
M: No, uh... I mean...
K: You used to pick up Skywrath a lot versus Brew, that was some first-phase stuff, remember that?
M: I like Skywrath, I think he's really good versus Brew and Wyvern, but...
F: Not so much versus Gyro.
M: Yeah.
F: Doesn't really synergise too well with their heroes either, no stuns on anyone.
M: They'd have to have core Undying too.
F: Yeah.
S: Wow. Core Undying. Woo! Good luck with that.
M: He's not too bad as an Offlaner.
S: Really? What, you pick up a Scepter [Aghanim's Scepter] and then... just go ham, or what?
F: He's a group-up hero.
M: Arcane [Boots], Mek [Mekansm]. Get levels and then just Tombstone people.
S: Okay, cool cool. Okay so last pick coming out, we got forty seconds of time, we're into the uh...
M: I don't know what EHOME want to commit to now because when you see Liquid's lineup, you're like 'I don't wanna teamfight into that, we [i.e. they] have curse, we have so much burst from Lina - we have good ways to deal [with the burst] with the Io but they kinda already committed to that with their three heroes, so.
F: Do they go for the Wraith King for themselves?
K: There aren't really any stuns or silence. They need something to contain... prevent Brew from doing as he pleases, Lina's gonna do as she pleases...
[EHOME Picks Batrider]
K: Well that's contain, I suppose, with the Lassoo. So.
S: I don't even know what's happening any more, this looks like Least Played Mode [least played is a game mode where only the 40 heroes you have won with the least are available to choose], I'm into it. Let's get this going - Batrider! Do people still play that hero?
F: He got played... in The Defense? Or something - he got played in a recent tournament like a week ago.
K: Alliance will go for it still, S4 likes the hero a lot, but he typically does still play it in that mid lane.
S: Does anyone good play it, or...? [as a joke] Ohhhhhhh. [weak laughter]
F: Memes. [I think? Kind of inaudible here.]
S: Just kidding, I love you S4.
[Liquid Bans Doom]
K: You know he's in the chat for sure. [laughter] He means it.
S: Ohhhhhh, I love you buddy. Alright so Aghs on Batrider, can we talk about that, anyone get that?
K: Luxury luxury.
M: Luxury luxury.
[EHOME Bans Disruptor]
F: Too much money.
K: I mean it's not far-fetched if he's getting to that fifth slot, sixth slot period, but you've still gotta get your toolbelt of course - you get your standard boots, force staff, after that you gotta get that BKB to make sure you get off that proper lasso [I think he meant to include blink in here, it's weird that he omitted it]. Boots of Travel, Mask of Madness I've seen a lot.
S: Doom banned out, as you guys were saying, he was a pretty good pick there as was Disruptor. Which is kind of the anti-teamfight hero, you know.
F: Just the Wisp, you know?
S: Right. So, what do we got, boys?
F: Well, Liquid's very low on time, so they gotta pick something any second now.
K: Their offlane grab...
[Liquid Picks Phoenix]
K: Oh! The Phoenix!
S: Hoo hoo hoo!
F: Okay you called it with the Least Played mode, this really does look like it.
S: What is this. This is SICK.
K: Too bad they can't go for that Skywrath Mage, but...
F: We haven't seen, like, three of those heroes are not really touched.
S: I am so pumped. If your mom's not watching this, call her up! This is gonna be one hell of a match.
K: Core Silencer, let's go.
M: They need a LOT more disables on EHOME. Silencer is...
K: Core Silencer man [laughing].
S: Do it, dude!
F: I feel like the Phoenix pick was just, more of a response to the Batrider than anything else, it's more teamfight, and if the Batrider does lasso you it's like 'okay, thank you' and if Phoenix is in the right position you just swoop in.
S: Sweet. Oh, I can't wait. Five more seconds.
K: Lack of disables, for EHOME...
M: What's CTY gonna play?
S: [inaudible]
F: The [inaudible] is pretty appropriate right there.
[EHOME Picks Anti-Mage]
S: Aghhh.
F: Anti-Mage, okay so they're just... I dunno, they're gonna just have to dodge, really hard. Dodge the fights. Forever.
S: Yeah they got one stun, and that is Batrider's ultimate. So...
K: They have a tremendous midgame among the other four.
F: Yeah, so if Viper and Undying have a very good start, then it'll be different, but the Anti-Mage anyway is obviously not going to be wanting to fight... and it does look like it is a Brewmaster offlane and a Phoenix/Wyvern supports..
S: Jeez.
K: Really?
F: Yeah that's what it's looking like.
S: I dunno. Ben, can you explain any of this?
F: How do you feel about this Ben?
M: I thought they were gonna pick Anti-Mage last game.
F: I did too! I thought they were gonna pick Anti-Mage as well.
M: 'Oh okay, now we're gonna go back to our usual stuff, now we lost last game. The Undying and the Anti-Mage.'
S: There was some lag problems, so maybe they meant to pick him last game and it's coming up now, I dunno.
F: They don't really have too much lockdown. They're gonna be playing the Wisp very differently, as you said before, it seems.
M: Yeah I think it's just gonna be to buff up the Viper.
