-transcription todo, prediction focus for paper-

-- PREDICTIONS --
//Merlini and Maelk propose two different openings for Vega, Merlini is correct but they're both weak suggestions so omitted here
1:24 - Purge predicts EG, SECOND PICK, EMBER SPIRIT - WRONG
//They name like seven heroes here, which is ludicrous, but Ember is the strongest. We need a better metric for measuring predictions? They don't mention Dazzle, either way.
3:25 - Maelk predicts EG, SECOND PHASE BAN, ANCIENT APPARITION - WRONG
4:25 - Maelk predicts EG, SECOND PHASE PICK, EMBER SPIRIT - WRONG, POTENTIALLY INCONCLUSIVE (VEGA PICK)
8:29 - Maelk predicts EG, LAST PICK, SILENCER - WRONG [WEAK] ("probably not going to happen")
10:25 - Purge predicts EG, LAST PICK, TIMBERSAW - WRONG
